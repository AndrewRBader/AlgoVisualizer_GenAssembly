This is the Backend of the algo visualizer app project 3 SEI

Proposal: going for a algorithm visualizer mern stack to help me prep for interviews
- hoping to show sorting algorithms with JS, python and Java to start
- backend will be express where algorighms are stored
- front end with show visual representation of algorithms chosen and will show the java, javascript, and python code
- will include JWT auth for user auth for practice as well

- run npm i to install dependencies when clone down
